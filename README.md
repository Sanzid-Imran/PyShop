# PyShop
 It's an online product stroe built with Django

This a project to get me familiar with the django framework . Connect with the database.
In here Sqllite is used.
Using migration the database was generated regarding the two models: Products and Offer inside model class.

From the developed admin panel of Django values were generated in the database

And in the views the data was fethed from the database using render and to give it sharp look bootsrtap is used along with html.
